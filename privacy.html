                        <p><strong>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data. This Privacy Policy for Wisecoin</strong></p>
                        <p>We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible from <a href="https://wisecoin.app/privacy.html">https://wisecoin.app/privacy.html</a></p>
                        <h5><strong>SECTION 1 - WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THIS INFORMATION?</strong></h5>
                        <p>When you enter into a transaction with our store as part of the purchase and sale process, we collect the personal information you give us such as: name, email and address.

                            When you access our site, we also automatically receive the internet protocol from your computer, IP address, to obtain information that helps us learn about your browser and operating system.

                            Email Marketing will be performed only if you allow. In these emails you can receive news about our store, new products and other updates.</p>
                        <h5><strong>SECTION 2 - CONSENT</strong></h5>
                        <p>How do you get my consent?

                            When you provide personal information such as name, phone, and address, to complete: a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange a delivery, or return a purchase. After performing actions we understand that you are in agreement with the data collection to be used by our company.

                            If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason such as marketing, we will ask you directly for your consent, or provide you with the opportunity to say no.

                            And if you want to withdraw your consent, how do you proceed?

                            If after you provide us with your data, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent so that we may contact you, for the collection of continuous data, use or disclosure of your information, at any time by contacting us at suport @ wisecoin.app or sending us a mail at: Wisecoin 6374 Vineland rd</p>
                        <h5><strong>SECTION 3 - DISCLOSURE</strong></h5>
                        <p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.</p>
                        <h5><strong>SECTION 4 - THIRD PARTY SERVICES</strong></h5>
                        <p>In general, third-party vendors used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to enable them to perform the services they provide to us.

                            However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies with respect to the information we are required to provide to them from their purchase-related transactions.

                            For these suppliers, we encourage you to read their privacy policies so that you can understand how your personal information will be used by those suppliers.

                            In particular, please remember that certain suppliers may be located in or have facilities that are located in different jurisdictions than you or us. Thus, if you want to continue with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction (s) in which the service provider or its facilities are located.

                            As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used to complete that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States law, including the Patriot Act .

                            Once you leave the site of our store or are redirected to a third party application or website, you will no longer be governed by this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service of our site.

                        <h5><strong>SECTION 5 - SAFETY</strong></h5>
                        <p>To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure that they will not be misappropriated, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.

                             If you provide us with your credit card information, this information is encrypted using secure socket layer (SSL) technology and stored with AES-256 encryption. Although no method of Internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional standards generally accepted by the industry.</p>
                        <h5><strong>SECTION 6 - CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h5>

Changes and clarifications will take effect immediately after their publication on the website. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here that they have been updated so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and / or disclose it.
